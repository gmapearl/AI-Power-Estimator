# AI-Power-Estimator
Estimate the power usage of a query per model, and suggest improvements 


AI Token Impact Calculator

This project helps users estimate the energy and water footprint of their AI prompts before sending them — and recommends the most efficient AI model based on their text input.

🌍 Goal: Empower users to optimize prompt size, choose sustainable models, and reduce environmental impact when using AI.
